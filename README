BTC-E arbitrage bot
-------------------

Continuously grabs offers and try to find profitable circular path. Upon finding such path, makes trades and exits

This piece of garbage lacks:
 - Non hardcoded configuration
 - Trade result checking
 - Persistent HTTP
 - Balance checks
 - Nonce autodetection
 - Fixed point math
